					<p class="date-type">05 November 2010</p>
					<p class="normal-type embed">This is my first post on this page. Might as well make it a short one since, this being a hello
						world post, it should follow a succinct and direct theme.</p> 
					<p class="normal-type">Welcome to my blog slash portfolio! This is a project i have started and stopped
						countless times in the past, since everytime i had myself convinced that this would be the time i would be able to finish it something always came up that i absolutely *had* to do, and this being a personal 
						ego-fulfilling side-project it had to take the back seat too many a times.</p>
					<p class="normal-type">But! This year was going to be different, and it is in so many ways. Proof of that fact is this very post.
						I actually decided that i would upload it earlier, rather than just waiting and tinkering with it until it's "perfect".
						So, all in all, to whoever reads this, thanks for visiting and i hope that by the time you get here i will have something
						a tad more useful to show for than this arbitrary first post :)</p>
					<p class="normal-type">P.S.: The "work" and "contact" sections are currently under construction. </p>

				<h2 class="korny-type-small">In a few words</h2>
				<p class="normal-type">I'm Spyros and I generally like to occupy myself with web development, mobile development and just a 
				tad of UI and web design. I study at the <a href="http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/">Computer Engineering &amp; Informatics Department</a> of the University of Patras 
				and like to keep myself busy at most times with anything that has to do with code.</p>
