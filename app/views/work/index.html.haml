      You can check out my recent projects in this section, work related or not. My interests lie mainly
      in web development, a tiny bit of designing and mobile application development so naturally those are the kind of projects
      you should expect to see around here.

            An informational web portal dedicated to the Infrastructure and Technical Support Sector of the
            Research Academic Computer Technology Insitute. This platform was built ontop of the Joomla CMS with modifications

            was developed for intranet-only use.

            A photography portfolio that was developed for a client, Khome productions. The theme as
            requested was "simplicity" and the template was designed with that in mind. The site was integrated into Wordpress
            for ease of use by the client, and supports news and gallery management with a custom built gallery script running
            on the frontend.

            Pavimento is one of the leading Linoleum-based floor and wall dressing companies in Greece.
            As part of their collaboration with other European companies in the field, they asked for a simple website that would
            help inform their clients about what they do and get a glimpse of their handywork.

            A simple issue tracker which was built and used during the development of the Tech Support
            Portal. The issue tracking of CVS systems such as BitBucket or GitHub was just too complex for the needs of the
            project and the number of people involved in it (One developer and one project manager), so I developed this handy tool
            to be able to publish issues fast and easy on a single feed like web app.

            As part of my undergraduate thesis at the Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of the
            UoP i developed an Android Application for handheld devices which simplifies the task of keeping track of ones everyday
            expenses. The app lets the user handle their monthly and total budget, create new budget categories and watch their spending
            expense patterns per month and budget category.
