This is a project i have started and stopped countless times in the past, since everytime i had myself convinced that this would be the time i would be able to finish it something always came up that i absolutely *had* to do, and this being a personal ego-fulfilling side-project it had to take the back seat too many a times. 

But! This year was going to be different, and it is in so many ways. Proof of that fact is this very post. I actually decided that i would upload it earlier, rather than just waiting and tinkering with it until it''s "perfect". So, all in all, to whoever reads this, thanks for visiting and i hope that by the time you get here i will have something a tad more useful to show for than this arbitrary first post :)
